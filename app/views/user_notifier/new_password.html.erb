We're sorry to hear your lost your password.  But, there's no need to worry,
because we've created a new, temporary password for you.

Your new password is: <%=h @new_password %>

You can change this password to something more memorable once you log into 
your account.  Just click the "Edit Profile" button.

Now, get back to Judging.  We know you're addicted.  It's okay.
